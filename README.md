# Howdy 🤠, I'm Mateus!

Hello, my name is Mateus Rodrigues Costa 🫡, but usually I go by MateusRodCosta.

I'm a Brazilian 🇧🇷 Programmer 👨‍💻 currently focusing on mobile apps development 📱.

- 💻 I'm currently specializing in mobile development with the [Flutter framework](https://flutter.dev/).
I also have interest in [Android](https://developer.android.com/), [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), [Linux](https://kernel.org/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/).

- 🥹 My current creation I'm most proud of is [Vidya Music](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mateusrodcosta.apps.vidyamusic) ([Source code](https://github.com/MateusRodCosta/vidya_music)),
which is a Flutter app for the [VIP Aersia](https://www.vipvgm.net/), a very popular video game music playlist that has been on the web for more than 14 years.
