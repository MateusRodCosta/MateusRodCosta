# Howdy 🤠! I'm Mateus

Hello, my name is Mateus Rodrigues Costa 🫡, MateusRodCosta for short, and I'm a Brazilian 🇧🇷 Programmer currently focusing on mobile apps development 📱.

- 👨‍💻 I'm currently specializing in mobile development with the [Flutter framework](https://flutter.dev/).
Some other technologies I have interest as well are Android, Jetpack Compose, Linux, Rust and GTK.

- 🥹 My current creation I'm most proud of is [Vidya Music](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mateusrodcosta.apps.vidyamusic) ([Source code](https://github.com/MateusRodCosta/vidya_music)),
which is a Flutter app for the very popular VIP Aersia video game music playlist that has been on the web for more than 10 years.
